# MITRE ATT&CK

***

## ATT&CK

is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. The ATT&CK knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community.

## ATT&CK Tactics

Tactics represent the "why" of an ATT&CK technique or sub-technique. It is the adversary's tactical goal: the reason for performing an action. For example, an adversary may want to achieve credential access. 

* `TA0043 Reconnaissance`  The adversary is trying to gather information they can use to plan future operations

* `TA0042 Resource Development`  The adversary is trying to establish resources they can use to support operations

* `TA0001 Initial Access`   The adversary is trying to get into your network

* `TA0002 Execution` The adversary is trying to run malicious code

* `TA0003 Persistence` The adversary is trying to maintain their foothold

* `TA0004 Privilege Escalation` The adversary is trying to gain higher-level permissions

* `TA0005 Defense Evasion` The adversary is trying to avoid being detected

* `TA0006 Credential Access` The adversary is trying to steal account names and passwords

* `TA0007 Discovery` The adversary is trying to figure out your environment

* `TA0008 Lateral Movement` The adversary is trying to move through your environment

* `TA0009 Collection` The adversary is trying to gather data of interest to their goal

* `TA0011 Command and Control` The adversary is trying to communicate with compromised systems to control them

* `TA0010 Exfiltration` The adversary is trying to steal data

* `TA0040  Impact` The adversary is trying to manipulate, interrupt, or destroy your systems and data

## ATT&CK Techniques

Techniques represent `how` an adversary achieves a tactical goal by performing an action. For example, an adversary may dump credentials to achieve credential access. 

* Techniques: 188
* Sub-techniques: 379

## ATT&CK Mitigation

 Mitigations represent security concepts and classes of technologies that can be used to prevent a technique or sub-technique from being successfully executed.
