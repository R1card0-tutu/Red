## Email as primary Transportation

`SPF` is a record that is part of your domain's DNS that contains a list of all the IP addresses that are permitted to send email on behalf of your domain

```bash
dig +short txt microdoft.com
```

`DKIM` allows the receiver to check that an email claimed to have come from a specific domain was indeed authorized by the owner of that domain

```bash
dig dkim._domainkey.redhat.com
```

`DMARC` is an email authentication protocol. It is designed to give email domain owners the ability to protect their domain from unauthorized use, commonly known as email spoofing

```bash
dig +short TXT _dmarc.redhat.com
```

`SPoofcheck` A program that checks if a domain can be spoofed from. The program checks SPF and DMARC records for weak configurations that allow spoofing.
